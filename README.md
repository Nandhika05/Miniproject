## Online Parking Booking System with AI Assistance

## About

The Online Parking Booking System is a web-based application designed to simplify parking space reservation by allowing users to search, book, and manage parking slots in real time. The system reduces manual effort, traffic congestion, and time spent searching for parking by providing a centralized digital platform with an intelligent assistant for user interaction.

Traditional parking systems often rely on manual allocation and lack real-time availability updates. This project overcomes these challenges by integrating smart booking features, location-based parking search, and a user-friendly interface for efficient parking management.

## Features

User registration and secure login system

Real-time parking slot availability

Online slot booking and cancellation

Smart assistant for parking-related queries

Location-based parking search

Scalable web-based architecture

Reduced time complexity and efficient slot management

Structured data handling using JSON

## Requirements

Operating System

Windows 10 / Ubuntu (64-bit)

Development Environment

Node.js (v16 or later)

JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend Technologies

Node.js with Express.js

MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas for database management

Frontend Technologies

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

React.js (optional for UI enhancement)

APIs & Services

Google Maps API (for parking location integration – optional/free tier)

RESTful APIs for booking and user management

IDE & Tools

Visual Studio Code

Git for version control

Postman for API testing

Additional Dependencies

Mongoose

Axios

JWT for authentication

## System Architecture

The system follows a client–server architecture where the frontend interacts with the backend via REST APIs. The backend handles authentication, parking slot allocation, and database operations, while MongoDB stores user and booking details.
